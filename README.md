# AI Landing Page

This project is a landing page that provides an overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subfields, including Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI in Robotics. It features a navigation bar, dynamic section highlighting as you scroll, and smooth scrolling between sections.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Automatically generated from the sections on the page.
- **Dynamic Section Highlighting**: As you scroll, the active section is highlighted both in the content and the navigation bar.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: The page supports smooth scrolling when clicking navigation links.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for mobile and desktop screens.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript is used to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically generate navigation items and update the UI based on user interaction (e.g., scrolling, clicking).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the page.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic behavior such as smooth scrolling, active section highlighting, and DOM manipulation for navigation items.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for icons in the footer.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-landing-page.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd ai-landing-page
    ```

3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your browser to view the page.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the content and structure of the landing page.
- `css/styles.css`: The stylesheet for the landing page.
- `js/app.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for dynamic behavior such as smooth scrolling, active section highlighting, and DOM manipulation.
- `js/images/`: Folder containing images used in the sections.

## How It Works

1. The page features four sections that describe various aspects of AI, including Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and AI in Robotics.
2. As you scroll through the page, the section currently in the viewport is dynamically highlighted with a golden border, and the corresponding navigation item is also highlighted.
3. The navigation bar allows for smooth scrolling between sections when a navigation link is clicked.
4. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes using media queries, ensuring responsiveness.
5. **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript is used to dynamically generate the navigation items based on the sections in the HTML. It also updates the active section based on the scroll position, and smooth scrolling is enabled when navigation links are clicked.

## Customizing

To customize the sections, simply edit the HTML content inside the `<section>` tags. You can add more sections, change images, or modify text as needed.

To change the color scheme or styles, modify the `css/styles.css` file.
